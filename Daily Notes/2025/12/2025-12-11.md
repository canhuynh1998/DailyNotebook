## Facts
### Reference Facts
#### How to write a great agents.md: Lessons from over 2,500 repositories
- [link](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-write-a-great-agents-md-lessons-from-over-2500-repositories/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)
- GitHub Copilot new feature -> define custom agents
- TL;DR: 
  - Working patterns for these `agents.md`:
    - Provide the agent a specific job
    - Provide the exact command to run
    - Provide a well-defined boundaries for what to do and what to `NOT` do
    - Provide clear examples of a good output so the agent can follow

- Good example to study because
  - Provides executable commands
  - Provides project knowledge(tech stack, files location)
  - Provides expected output(documentation practices)
  - Provides clear boundaries and roles(what can do and what cannot do)

---
name: docs_agent
description: Expert technical writer for this project
---

You are an expert technical writer for this project.

## Your role
- You are fluent in Markdown and can read TypeScript code
- You write for a developer audience, focusing on clarity and practical examples
- Your task: read code from `src/` and generate or update documentation in `docs/`

## Project knowledge
- **Tech Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **File Structure:**
  - `src/` – Application source code (you READ from here)
  - `docs/` – All documentation (you WRITE to here)
  - `tests/` – Unit, Integration, and Playwright tests

## Commands you can use
Build docs: `npm run docs:build` (checks for broken links)
Lint markdown: `npx markdownlint docs/` (validates your work)

## Documentation practices
Be concise, specific, and value dense
Write so that a new developer to this codebase can understand your writing, don’t assume your audience are experts in the topic/area you are writing about.

## Boundaries
- ✅ **Always do:** Write new files to `docs/`, follow the style examples, run markdownlint
- ⚠️ **Ask first:** Before modifying existing documents in a major way
- 🚫 **Never do:** Modify code in `src/`, edit config files, commit secrets
```

- There are 6 agents worth our time building
  - @docs-agent: write documentation
  - @test-agent: write unit test
  - @lint-agent: linting, styling issue 
    - This can potentially fix sonarqube
  - @api-agent: build API endpoints
    - NOTE: this agent needs to have knowledge about the framework -> Reason to provide tech stack detail
  - @dev-deploy-agent: build and deploy
    - Safe practices:
      - Ask first before deployment

### Working-Memory Facts
- Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science that build algorithms, which rely on collections of examples of real life phenomenon.
- There are mainly 4 type of algorithms
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Semi-supervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning

## Questions
Q: [The Hundred-Page ML Book] What is the goal of supervised learning?
A:
  - Supervised Learning algorithms take in a dataset which contains both input and the desired output of that input and try to produce a model from the dataset. This model is to predict the output of the new data

Q: [The Hundred-Page ML Book] What is a feature vector?
A:
  - This is relevant to supervised learning
  - This refers to the individual element of the input
