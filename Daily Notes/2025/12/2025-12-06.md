  - What is distributed system?
    - Loosely speaking distributed systems are a set of nodes(machines, processes) that communicate with each other so that a program can properly function
  - What are the main challenges for building distributed systems?
    - Communication refers to how nodes communicate with each other over the network. Challenges come in since network can be unreliable
    - Coordination refers to how nodes maintain the order of the messages sent over the network as latency is expected
    - Scalability refers to how effective the system handles load
    - Resiliency refers to how resilient the system is when failures happen 
    - Operation refers to testing, deployment, maintaining, etc.
  - Distributed system anatomy
    - Inbound interface refers to the API that external services call to execute the business logic of a particular service
      - Merchant wants to perform an auth for amexdirect. Merchant calls an auth endpoint and this request triggers amexdirect auth logic
    - Outbound interface refers to the API that a service calls to communicate with other services
